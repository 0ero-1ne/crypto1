What is life but a fevered dream?
Their eyes are yet to open
The gears are set in place to guide me to affinity
Atrophy, the thorn of time's aging vine
Harrowing winds press the mesh and curse the flesh
Rotting away
But here in this reality, my thoughts transform fatality
An almost endless exploration of our cosmic minds
Perpetuated through the sands of time
Contort reality, distort fallacy, pave my way
Contort reality, resort to malady
This lucid dream lingers onward, indefinitely
I am one
Omnipotent, I am the one
Icarus, I'll touch the sun
As you sow, and so you shall reap
What is life, if but a fevered dream?
Restless nexus, my consensus
Striking at god at fucking will
Yet and I am still not even satisfied
I fabricate, manipulate, incinerate and duplicate
Restabilize the precipice, my arbitrary exodus inside
Where I confide, looking down on this steeple
Contort reality, distort fallacy, pave my way
Contort reality, resort to malady
This lucid dream lingers onward, indefinitely
I descend
Despairing plunge unto the omniverse, sinking deeper
We relinquish pasts, as we forget the difference
Losing ourselves in the infinite
Despairing plunge unto the omniverse, sinking deeper
We relinquish pasts, as we forget the difference
Losing ourselves as we become
Omnipotent, I am the one
Icarus, I'll touch the sun
Omnipotent
Icarus, I'll eat the sun
These fragile wings will touch the sky (touch the sky)
And paint the world in black and white (black and white)
Bring forth the cleansing fires of rebirth
Recreating my image within the paradoxical
Burn in the embers of my fevered heart
Witness my omnipotence
Cursed judgment, devoid of this flesh, bring for my affinity
I am the omnipotent being
Icarus, I'll touch the sun
Omnipotent, I am the one
Icarus, I'll touch the sun
Omnipotent, I am the one
Icarus, I'll eat the sun
