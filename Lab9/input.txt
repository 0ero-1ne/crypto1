Three members of Linkin Park are mulling a possible 2025 reunion tour and are considering hiring a female vocalist to succeed late lead singer Chester Bennington, several sources close to the band tell Billboard. Booking agency WME is taking offers for a potential Linkin Park tour along with headlining festival dates featuring Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson and Dave Farrell, the sources say. The band has not indicated who will sing on behalf of Bennington, who was often praised as one of the most gifted and durable vocalists of the 2000s with a dynamic range tailor-made for the group's genre-bending style. One source tells Billboard the band is hoping to find a female vocalist to front the reunited band, matching rumors that have been making the rounds in recent weeks. On March 30, during an appearance on Wired in the Empire on KCAL 96.7, Orgy's Jay Gordon said he had heard rumors about a Linkin Park reunion. "Very, very cool guys and obviously a great band," he said. "They've been around a long time and they're still going for it," he said. "It's going to be tough without Chester, but we'll see. I hear they got a girl singer now. That's what I heard." Gordon later issued a statement saying his comments had been taken out of context, writing, "With regards to this linkin park singer thing. I know nothing about any of that." Earlier this month, Evanescence frontwoman Amy Lee shot down rumors that she might be a candidate for the lead vocal gig. On April 23, the singer told iHeartRadio Canada that, while some Linkin Park fans had been voicing hopes for her to join the band, the group had not contacted her for the gig. "But that's awesome," she said. "They should ask me about that. I don't have a ton of free time, but I might do it part-time."
